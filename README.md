## RR COURSE- UPDATE - WEEK - 05

## Description

For this project I create the HTML structure for a new page that contain a form to
register to the page.

In Addtion to the HTML I added the styles for the behaviour of the page to
be able to visualize it in differents devices.

The fields contained in the form must be validated.

We do this by manipulating the DOM with Javascript and adding functions in the events.

## RR COURSE- UPDATE - WEEK - 06

## Description

The objective of the 6th week was to create JS functions to validate the user's data when clicking in the button 'Subscribe!' and sending it to a server through an HTTP request.  If the data validation is correct, the modal should show a success message with all of the data provided by the user. Also, the information is stored in the local storage and when the user reloads the page, the user's info is pre-loaded in the form.
If the data is incorrect, the modal shouls show an error message and nothing is stored in the local storage.
