## RR COURSE- UPDATE - WEEK - 05

## Description

For this project I create the HTML structure for a new page that contain a form to
register to the page.

In Addtion to the HTML I added the styles for the behaviour of the page to
be able to visualize it in differents devices.

The fields contained in the form must be validated.

We do this by manipulating the DOM with Javascript and adding functions in the events.
